     <p> This analysis shows all key words from descriptions of the Criterion Collection dataset. 
       <br> The key words are references to the movie: words like film and director. 
        <br> Anyways, some words like new, life, love, american and young are important to describe the whole of the collection. 
        <br> We can think that those are the promise to the user of this collection.
        <br> Furthermore, the Criterion collection is formed by a great diversity of movies that talk more about cinema than hollywood, but using it both

       <p> This plot shows all the film's posters from the Criterion Collection dataset. The plot has an X axis by lightness and Y axis by Hue. The thumb width is 153px and the thumb height is 190px
      <br> We can observe that there's a majority of posters that are black or dark, then a lot of blue and red posters and finally white. 
        <br> Also, there green posters are minority and they're represented by faces. 
        <br> This datavisualisation allows to realize that some posters are extremly white or black.
        <br> Furthermore, the Criterion collection is formed by a great diversity of movies with red and yellow posters
